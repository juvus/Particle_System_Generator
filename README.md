# Particle System Generator

## 1. Introduction
One of the problems faced by developers of systems for recognition of particles (their size and shape) is the difficulty in assessing the quality of such recognition. The system, which is always able to give the final result, cannot determine how close it is to reality, since information about the system of tested particles is not known in advance. One obvious solution to the problem is to calibrate the system (and adjust recognition algorithms) on some reference material, and then use the calibrated system to recognize particles of the real material.
The creation of reference materials with, for example, spherical particles of medium size can be solved and quite often is already used to test the behavior of systems that make particle recognition. But such task is significantly complicated when it is necessary to create spherical particles of micron-level size, or when it is necessary to obtain a mixture from many particles, where the shape parameters would be distributed according to a known law. If it is necessary to create particles of irregular shape, and even so that the shape parameters would be distributed according to a law known in advance, then the task becomes practically impossible. Therefore, to test algorithms for the recognition of particles of irregular shapes, it is necessary to use other approaches, one of which is, for instance, the creation of artificial images with the particle sizes and shapes we need. 
Developed application with graphical user interface (GUI) is trying to solve the problem. It is designed to create images with artificially generated 2D particles. An important feature of such particle generation is that particles are generated in accordance with desired and predefined distribution of sizes and shape parameters (PSD, Circularity, Convexity and Elongation).
